# Setup Developer Environment

This is a basic script to setup a basic development environment.

Included Applications:

- curl
- git
- VS Code + Extensions
- Node
- kubectl
- Rancher Desktop

## Instructions

1. Download archive 
2. Extract archive
3. chmod +x ./init.sh
4. run ./init.sh
5. run rancher-desktop
    - This step needs to be run to pick version of k8s to use and configure containerd vs dockerd

1. install nerdctl instead of kubectl?
2. fix start rancher-desktop
